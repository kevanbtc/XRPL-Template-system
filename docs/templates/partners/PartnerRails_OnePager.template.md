## Your Vaults
- [RUBY-VAULT-____]
- [SANTANDER-JV-VAULT-____]
- [IQD-BOX-VAULT-____]
- [CN-LEGACY-BOND-VAULT-____]

Manager: Unykorn (rails, compliance, PoR). Ownership: You (SPV equity). Transparency: IPFS dossiers + on-chain proofs.

## Classification
- Tier 1: Bankable RWA (verified) → counted for collateral at conservative LTV
- Tier 2: Speculative/deal-by-deal → disclosed, 0% LTV unless term sheet
- Tier 3: Legacy/collectible → disclosed, 0% LTV

## Monetization Paths
- Credit line / repo against Tier-1 assets
- Private placement notes with AFO waterfalls
- White-label programs on Unykorn rails

## Options
- A) Pure Rails Vendor (setup + annual + success fee)
- B) Co-Owner/Structuring Partner (equity split; cost recovery; profit share)
- C) White-Label Rail (your brand, our OS)

## Guardrails
- We never count Tier-2/3 in reserves
- Bank confirmations and appraisals go to IPFS
- Daily PoR for any facility used as backing
