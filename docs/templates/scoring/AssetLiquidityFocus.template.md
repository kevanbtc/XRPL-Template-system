Scoring Run ID / Timestamp: **[e.g., 2025-11-17T02:30Z]**

## 1. Immediate Focus (Execute Now – Top 1–3 Assets)

These are the highest composite score + valid (non-Reject) assets. They should get ~40% of attention.

### 1.1 Asset #1 – [Name]

- Bucket: **Immediate**
- Score: **[XX.XX]**
- Time to Cash (TTC): **[1–5]**
- LTV: **[1–5]**
- Liquidity Depth (LD): **[1–5]**
- Compliance & Counterparty (CC): **[1–5]**
- Verification (VF): **[1–5]**

**Why this is top of stack (auto-filled from report):**  
> [Paste summary from `asset_scores.md`]

**Next 7 days – concrete steps:**

- [ ] Step 1 – [e.g., finalize license term sheet with Party A]
- [ ] Step 2 – [e.g., prepare receivable facility / note docs]
- [ ] Step 3 – [e.g., push into Bank Filings page with PoR / narrative]

**Path to wired cash:**

- Target Amount: **[e.g., $250k–$500k]**
- Target Date: **[YYYY-MM-DD]**
- Required Signatures / Approvals: **[names / roles]**

### 1.3 Asset #3 – [Name]

[Repeat structure above, optional]

## 2. Near-Term Assets (Unlock → Promote to Immediate)

These are “almost there”: TTC and LD are decent, but blocked by 1–3 missing pieces.

### 2.1 Asset – [Name]

- Bucket: **Near-Term**
- Score: **[XX.XX]**
- Current TTC: **[1–5]** → Target TTC: **[4–5]**
- Current LD: **[1–5]** → Target LD: **[3–4]**

**Key Unlocks (do these first):**

- [ ] [e.g., Independent appraisal]
- [ ] [e.g., Buyer LOI(s) or investor expressions]
- [ ] [e.g., Legal memo / enforceability opinion]
- [ ] [e.g., On-ledger PoR narrative + Bank Filings entry]

**When it flips to Immediate:**
> [Describe specific condition: “once 2 LOIs signed + appraisal uploaded to IPFS + KYC cleared”]

---

## 3. Background Assets (Cheap Progress Only)

These should **not** steal cycles from Immediate / Near-Term. You only do cheap moves.

### 3.1 Asset – [Name]

- Bucket: **Background**
- Score: **[XX.XX]**

**Cheap improvements (<2 hours / <$250):**

- [ ] Document collection (IDs, contracts, photos, scans)
- [ ] Basic PoR narrative draft
- [ ] Light counterparty mapping

**Review cadence:** [Weekly / Bi-weekly / Monthly]

---

## 4. Reject Log (“Dogshit” Until Facts Change)

Use this to **write down why** something is in the bin so future-you doesn’t get seduced by the same nonsense.

### 4.1 Asset – [Name]

- Status: **Reject / Dogshit**
- Composite Score: **[X.XX]**
- Auto-Reject Trigger(s):
            - [ ] TTC == 0
            - [ ] VF <= 1
            - [ ] CC <= 1
            - [ ] LD <= 1 **and** LTV <= 1

**Reason(s):**
> [Short narrative – “no regulated venue, unverifiable docs, history of scams, no credible buyer rail”]

**Rule:**
> No time / money until **new, verifiable evidence** appears (e.g., court ruling, regulated venue, audited docs).

**Next Review Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD or “None”]

---

## 5. Bandwidth Allocation (per sprint)

- Immediate assets: **~40%**
- Near-Term unlocks: **~30%**
- Background / cheap docs: **~20%**
- Admin / system tuning: **~10%**

---

## 6. Notes & Deviations

Use this if you deliberately deviate from the scores (e.g., strategic asset, relationship reasons).

- [ ] Deviation #1 – [Asset name & reason]
- [ ] Deviation #2 – [Asset name & reason]
